# Pyber_vis

## Overview of the analysis
   
The Purpose of this analysis is to give PyBer's leadership ride share data by city type for the companies leadership to use in decision making. 
## Results
 
   In the screenshot below we can see that the cost of a ride is directly related to the amount of drivers in an area. Rural drivers make more money becasue rural passengers pay more for the service due to lower driver availability. This makes sense as the service is more valuable the more scarce it is.

## Summary
    
   Senior leadership should likely focus on understanding their driving trends, and incentivising more people to be drivers in certain types of areas in order to bring costs to consumers down. Pyber would likely do better in rural and suburban markets if it were less expensive. In addition to getting more drivers outside of urban areas, the CEO should also look into the different types of trips people in different markets are taking with their service.
