The written analysis has the following:
## Overview of the analysis:
    * The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
    The Purpose of this analysis is to give PyBer's leadership ride share data by city type for the companies leadership to use in decision making. 
## Results:
    * There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
    In the screenshot below we can see that the cost of a ride is directly related to the amount of drivers in an area. Rural drivers make more money becasue rural passengers pay more for the service due to lower driver availability. This makes sense as the service is more valuable the more scarce it is.

## Summary:
    * There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
    
    Senior leadership should likely focus on understanding their driving trends, and incentivising more people to be drivers in certain types of areas in order to bring costs to consumers down. Pyber would likely do better in rural and suburban markets if it were less expensive. In addition to getting more drivers outside of urban areas, the CEO should also look into the different types of trips people in different markets are taking with their service.
